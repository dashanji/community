## Vineyard Runtime Design

#### Background

###### Why we need vineyard?

The following is a common big data workflow case.

Challenges: Using external storage (local disk or cloud S3, OSS service, etc.) to implement data exchange will bring a lot of I/O consumption, often becoming the entire Workflow bottlenecks

###### What is Vineyard?

[Vineyard](https://github.com/v6d-io/v6d) is a distributed in-memory data management system, it provides the following features:

- Leverage the local shared memory: avoid unnecessary memory copies, serialization/deserialization, file I/O and network transmission, etc.
- Distributed: support for distributed data between different systems.
- Cloud Native: Deeply integrate with Kubernetes ecosystem, including operator, scheduler-plugin, csi-plugin, etc.
- Simple and easy-to-use SDK: includes python, c++, rust, java and golang, etc.

###### How to use vineyard in kubernetes

Each object in the vineyard is composed of metadata + payload:

- Vineyardd: shared memory manager, which stores payload information.
- Etcd: Metadata management, storing metadata information.

The following is the layout of vineyard components in kubernetes:

###### Vineyard data access method

- RPC: Slow, data needs to be migrated to task pods.
- IPC: Fast, but require task pods and vineyardd pods to store data co-locate.

###### Important configuration in vineyard: shared memory

- vineyardd itself supports a `size limit` that allows users to set it. 
- What if the shared memory is not enough?
  - Vineyard allows an optional spill configuration.
    - Use external storage (local disk/cloud oss, S3, etc.) for data storage. 
    - When there is memory pressure, automatically spill objects that are not currently in use.
    - When spilled objects are reused, vineyard will automatically reload.
  - Transparent to users.

###### The observability of vineyardâ€™s shared memory in kubernetes

- Counted on vineyardd pod
  - The reserve memory option needs to be set as `true` when starting vineyardd.
- Counted on task pod
  - The reserve memory option needs to be set as `false` when starting vineyardd.

#### Integrate with fluid

###### How to mount vineyard socket and perform service discovery.

- Create a socket in the specified directory and expose the configuration file (configmap) of the vineyard service (IPC and RPC).
  - Vineyardd will create a socket in the directory where the hostpath is `/runtime-mnt/vineyard/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/{{ template "vineyard.fullname" . }}`.
  - In order to be compatible with the fluid-fuse detection mechanism, vineyard fuse mounts the configmap to `/runtime-mnt/vineyard/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/{{ template "vineyard.fullname" . }}/vineyard-fuse/dummy-path`.
  - Vineyard fuse will mount the `/runtime-mnt/vineyard/{{ .Release.Namespace }}/{{ template "vineyard.fullname" . }}` directory to `/runtime-mnt/vineyard/{{ .Release.Namespace } }/{{ template "vineyard.fullname" . }}/vineyard-fuse`. 
- How tasks perform service discovery?
  - Add `fuse.vineyard.fluid.io/inject: "true"` label for task Pod, and inject configmap env.


- How task pod access data.
  - Via IPC: Task pod and vineyardd pod containing data are required to co-locate.
    - To achieve this, we could leverage the [existing fluid scheduling mechanism](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/blob/master/docs/en/operation/pod_schedule_optimization.md).
  - Via RPC: No need for task pods and vineyardd pods containing data to co-locate.
    - Currently, the rpc API is experimental, and it will be stably supported before the next major version of vineyard.

###### Best Practice

- How to set the vineyard pod's own `required`, `limits`, and vineyardd's `size-limit`.
  - The reserve memory option is enabled by default. The default size-limit of vineyardd is 256Mi, while the required and limits of vineyard pod are 256Mi + 100Mi(for vineyardd itself). If the user sets the size-limit to 8Gi, the required limits of the vineyard pod become 8Gi + 100Mi.

- How to set the required and limits of task pod memory.
  - When the `reserveMemory` option is enabled.
    - Shared memory is counted in vineyardd and does not occupy the memory quota of task pod.
    - When the task pod migrates data to vineyard, there is no need to increase the required memory `required` and `limits`.
  - When the `reserveMemory` option is disabled.
    - Shared memory is counted in the task pod and occupies the memory quota of the task pod.
      - For reader tasks, there is no need to increase the `required` and `limits` of additional memory.
      - For writer tasks, the shared memory size needs to be added to `required` and `limits`.

- Optimum performance.
  - leverage the [existing fluid scheduling mechanism](https://github.com/fluid-cloudnative/fluid/blob/master/docs/en/operation/pod_schedule_optimization.md), and use IPC to access data as much as possible.
